# The groupName here is used to identify the company or business unit that
# created this webhook.
# This name will need to be referenced in each Issuer's `webhook` stanza to
# inform cert-manager of where to send ChallengePayload resources in order to
# solve the DNS01 challenge.
# Users should not generally need to edit the groupName.
groupName: acme.nsone.net

# Nameservers is used to force the webhook to use specific name servers.
# This is useful when you have a split DNS service that might return
# SOA records internally that don't exist in NSOne.
